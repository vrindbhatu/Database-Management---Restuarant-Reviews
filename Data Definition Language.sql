Without exaggeration, those changed my life. I''ve never had anything that tasted that good. The tacologists that created the recipe to those honey dew drops from 
heaven should be given a Nobel peace prize for the gift they have provided us here in the DMV. No tacos come close. I''ve tried so many tacos, but I always 
find myself coming back to Tacos a la Madre. Their food is top notch and their customer service is phenomenal. I''m so glad they have found a home in College Park 
because now I will be going here every week. This is not a joke.

the restaurant (sorry Waze lady, I should have listened to you) so we were late. When we found the restaurant it stood alone and had a parking lot in the back. 
We told our friends to start without us so when we finally arrived we just ordered single tacos.  Our server was nice and attentive, but it was hard to understand 
her with a mask on. She asked me something about my taco and I only heard ""grilled chicken"" so I said yes. Well it turned out I had ordered a soft taco. Husband 
was nice enough to trade his crispy taco for mine. The chicken in the taco was nicely grilled and it was served with a fairly standard platter of rice and beans. 
The food was good but the disappointment was the margarita. It was rather bland and I really didn''t taste of any alcohol.

The restaurant itself is pleasant with a reception area as you enter and restrooms off to the side. There''s an entrance into the dining room that is L-shaped. 
They weren''t crowded at lunch time and I appreciated that they were social distancing the other customers. If invited to meet friends I''d go again 
(especially now that I know where it is) but it won''t replace my go-to favorite restaurant to get delicious margaritas and chips with salsa that is addictive.','2'),

Loved the family ambiance of seeing everyone working together in the back. But $15 for 3 birria tacos with consomme is kind of steep if you ask me. Where I''m from that 
would get you a whole dinner with rice and beans. However that being said I will be coming back just closer to pay day','0'),

My friend and I stopped by on a busy weekday. There was a light out the door. Parking was luckily easy to find even with the lot being entirely filled. 
We ordered the barbacoa, carnitas, pastor, carne asada, cachete, chorizo and lengua. Wow flavors here are on point. Meats were seasoned well, tender and juicy. 
The way they pack it as well its so efficient. Stuffed in some aluminum foil. When I got home 15 minutes after they were still piping hot. I personally loved the lengua, 
carnitas, pastor and cachete the most. They packed the most flavor. If you want to indulge and don''t mind the calories then go with the pork ones. 
I''m glad my friend recommended this place as I will definitely be coming back. Expect quick service, authentic Mexican tacos and delicious flavors. 
Don''t be turned away by the long lines this is now my favorite taco spot in the area!','2'),

Al pastor did not have the sweetness to like I would have imagined. The tongue was great! I thought all the meats were a dry. So I had to put on a lot of lime and salsa. 
Good thing their salsa was not too spicy.','1'),

I will try to come here when in the DC area. Man, I was so happy to have enjoyed and come back twice here! We went when it was packed not realizing there was a 
soccer match between USA & Mexico (USA won! Yay! Sorry) and even though packed, the employees were on it getting through everyone''s order quick and ensuring a 
minimal wait time. With covid and all, there was a long but we only waited roughly 15 mins, so not too bad considering the food came out in less than 5 mins. 
What is also cool is that if you dine in, they will have a server being your food to you, following you to the table bench of your choice. I really liked the 
neighborhood vibe of the locals, I felt comfortable and one with the locals lol. Made the experience well worth it and the food more enjoyable.
What is unfortunate is that the two times I went, my order was incorrect :''( but I still ate good lmao. The first time I asked for two Tripa Tacos 
and instead one was with Trompa Taco, but it was good so whatever lol. The second time, I asked for four tacos and only for charged for three :( 
lol so not much of a complaint but the cashier maybe will need to slow it down in the typing part? Because they repeated what I ordered as they entered it 
so maybe the POS (looked outdated too) couldn''t keep up with the entering fast pace of the employee?
The sauces that come with it is very authentic and delicious! You get more bang for your dollar here. I will say that I don''t think the tortillas are hand made 
or authentic but the rest is legit. :) Employees are nice too so be nice and patient. Can''t wait to go back and order more tacos!!!','5'),

Their mole is rich, smoky, and delicious, plus it''s huge and reasonably priced. The rice and beans were good too, but the mole takes center stage. 
I also had an al pastor taco and snacked on some chicharrones de harina with hot sauce. The taco was great, and I enjoyed my chicharrones. No strawberry soda though.

The staff is friendly, but the place is small and the parking is tough. Try coming a bit later at night for better parking, but definitely do try to get here,

The fish tacos were also delicious. The spicy margarita was superb but don''t get the hibiscus margarita which was too sweet and lacked any complexity.
The service was frustrating. After a long wait past our reservation time to be seated we were helped quickly, and the food came quickly. 
But as soon as the food was dropped off we didn''t see anyone for 25 minutes. To be more accurate: we saw a staff member at another table twice but couldn''t 
get his attention (despite waving with hands up high). We gave up trying to order another drink, but then couldn''t get our bill. It was a disappointing end to a 
delicious meal. We will certainly go again on the hope that this was a one-off issue.','0');
